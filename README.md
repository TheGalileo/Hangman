The popular word game, Hangman. Developed using Python2.7 and Tkinter for simple GUI.  
  
### Description :  
This is a simple coding task that I did during the slacking days of summer.  
I wrote the code in Python and added simple GUI using Tkinter, to do away with the CLI (It increases the audience considerably.)  
  
### Suggestions:  
Some suggestions that are to be implemented are as follows:  
1. Activation of the enter key to submit the guesses.  
2. Adding the graphics of a hanging man.  
3. A better words.txt has to be included. There are some issues with the current one.
