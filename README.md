# Hangman
The popular word game, Hangman. Developed using Python2.7 and Tkinter for simple GUI.


Description :
This is a simple coding task that I did during the slacking days of summer.
I wrote the code in Python and added simple GUI using Tkinter, to do away with the CLI (It increases the audience considerably.)

Suggestions:
Some suggestions that are to be implemented are as follows:
1. Activation of the enter key to submit the guesses.
2. Adding the graphics of a hanging man.
