The popular word game, Hangman. Developed using Python2.7 and Tkinter for simple GUI.

Credits:
Due credits are to be given to the creators of py2exe. It was because of them that THIS can be run even on systems that don't have Python directories installed in them.

Description :
This is a simple coding task that I did during the slacking days of summer.
I wrote the code in Python and added simple GUI using Tkinter, to do away with the CLI (It increases the audience considerably.)

Suggestions:
Some suggestions that are to be implemented are as follows:
1. Activation of the enter key to submit the guesses.
2. Adding the graphics of a hanging man.
3. A better words.txt has to be included. There are some issues with the current one.
